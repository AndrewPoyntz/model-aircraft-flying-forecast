# Model Aircraft Flying Forecast (MAFF)

This is a project created as part of a pre-interview task for a senior front end developer job at the Met Office (which I got!)

Written in AngularJS, as it allows for future expansion such as more locations and using the real data feeds.

[Live demo](http://andrewpoyntz.co.uk/maff/app/)


I didn't have enough time to unit test the entire application & get in all the functionality I wanted to, so I have created some unit tests for the forecast controller & utils factory to show how I'd usually approach it.
