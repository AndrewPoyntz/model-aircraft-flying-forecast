# Model Aircraft Flying Forecast (MAFF)

This is a project created as part of a pre-interview task many years ago, for a senior front end developer job at the Met Office (which I got!)

[Live demo](http://andrewpoyntz.co.uk/model-aircraft-flying-forecast/app/)

run NPM install in the root to pull down the dependencies 


I didn't have enough time to unit test the entire application & get in all the functionality I wanted to, so I have created some unit tests for the forecast controller & utils factory to show how I'd usually approach it.

The data and app is not in any way associated with the Met Office it's self. 

**2022 update**: requires node 4.X.X to run any of the gulp commands and install it (literally wont work on newer versions due to the age of dependencies)
